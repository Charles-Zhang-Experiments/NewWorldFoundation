# New World Foundation (NWF)

Tags: NFMS, Initiative

To serve more reliable and progressive construction of a new world (virtual digital world with digital assets and projects), I take data integrity very seriously, especially concerning unreliability of SSD storage and cloud services. I thus provide a heavily opinionated whole system backup scheme offering reliable, fast and cheap solution to data backup and integrity problems leveraging the best tools possible for fastest and most efficient experience. On the simplest level, this is a manual backup tool replacing iDrive/Backblaze for local-based bacup and works as compliment to OneDrive. This complies to NFMS but should provide a generic framework for configuration.

On the more advanced level, this tool provide robust indexing and in the future provide direct cloud backup integration through plugins.

Features:

|Feature|Function|
|-|-|
|Manual Backup|Starts Incremental Backup and Folder Structure Mirroring; Instantly see exactly what will be changed before anything happens|
|NFMS Viewer|Provide unified views at arbitrary roots|

Notice back up is not enough, to provide resilliency, it's recommended that we distribute storage of data according to their usage type/access frequency, so even if one disk fails, others still stands.

## Specification

Behavior of entry problem is configured through a single YAML configuration file.

Example:

```yaml
Mirrors:
  - Master: C:\Projects
    Copy: 
    Condition: Exact|Fragment|Stash|Transient
```

Conditions:

|Condition|Meaning|
|-|-|
|Transient|Save as Exact except it only backs up text files (default txt md and code files) and other optional types of smaller than some threshold file size (default 1Mb)|

Notice below configuration-time and runtime behaviors:

- All mirror items can be either on a file basis or folder basis
- More specific rules overwrite general rules, use option to issue warning and halt back up process instead
- Existing files will be replaced with newer files
- WE WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY DETECT FILE/FOLDER MOVEMENTS OUTSIDE OF SPECIFIED LOCATION because of the nature of specific folder/file mapping, also see next point
- When marked as Full or Partial condition, we will make deductions on potential file movements on the destination. "Backup" condition will not delete anything in the destination.

Would be nice if we can draw some kind of tree or flow chart to indicate where data is flowing into where. Actually make a data instead, it's clearer.

## Components

Each individual component shall be used as Pure library or as CLI tool.

* (Todo) Indexer: Creative viewable (binary or HTML) indexer for images and main items (useful for situations like Creative Assets and Sketches) in a single file.

## Abstraction & Concepts

To the tool, it just sees disk locations, and maybe network locations (through drivers), and it provides manipulation for those. It identifies a Master and a Copy, where the copy will deligently mirror the exact content and structure of master, under a root.

## TODO

Utility:

- [ ] Implement Everything Service on `.sm` files.
  * Used to add annotations (e.g. tags) to any file system entry.
  * Shorthand for Somewhere(2) metadata files.
  * Simple plain Key-value format.
  * See `OneDrive\ProjectNine (Experiments)\The Walking Simulator\Game\_ProjectNine\NFC\Assets\Scenes\NFC\Main\SeventhFloor.sm` for example.
